      <p>The Sunlight Foundation now offers a new way to review and receive federal campaign finance data for candidates, PACs and outside spending groups. The “Real-Time FEC” section of Influence Explorer takes official Federal Election Commission data for the current election cycle and presents it in a more user-friendly format.</p>

      <p>
      We automatically gather FEC data from a variety of sources (read more below), present both "soft" and "hard" money together and make the itemized transactions--including committee spending--downloadable on a nearly-immediate basis.</p>

      <p>This site also allows users to receive customized email alerts for when a particular committee submits a new electronic filing to the FEC. Maintaining and aggregating this information on an ongoing basis requires a relatively complex process, which is detailed at some length below.</p>

      <p>Realtime FEC is Sunlight’s first step in providing more immediate data offerings on Influence Explorer. Tools developed for the Sunlight Reporting Group will be rolled into this site in the coming months. For instance, Realtime FEC is the new iteration of "Follow The Unlimited Money"</p>

      <p>Please note, that data on the Real-Time FEC section of Influence Explorer is different than campaign finance data available on the rest of the site (eg. profile pages and in the data portal).</p>

      <p>While <a href="http://influenceexplorer.com">influenceexplorer.com</a> uses federal campaign finance data from the Center for Responsive Politics and state data from the National Institute of Money in State Politics, <a href="/">realtime.influenceexplorer.com</a> uses only data directly from the Federal Election Commission. Both CRP and NIMSP "code" campaign contribution data by donor industry--but doing so takes time.  Data received from these groups often runs months behind. Moreover, these sources don't provide complete campaign finance information; for instance, spending data is not provided.</p>

      <p>For more information or if you have questions, please <a href="mailto:realtimefec@sunlightfoundation.com">contact us</a>. Members of the media should contact Sunlight’s Media Director Liz Bartolomeo at 202-742-1520 ext. 226.</p>

          <h4>How to Use the Site</h4>
      </div>      
      
      <p><b>Real-Time FEC is segmented into seven sections:</b></p>
      
      
      <p id="newest_filings"><a href="/newest-filings/">Newest filings</a> provides a feed of all electronic filings submitted to the FEC. Use the filters and quick links to narrow down the results shown on the page. Data is from Jan. 1, 2013 through the current date and time listed. This is a good feed to use around quarterly and monthly filing deadlines. Click on the filing ID to review its details, click on the committee name to see all its filings on Real-Time FEC and click on the dollar figures to see a breakdown of its contributions and expenditures.</p>

      <p id="new-committees"><a href="new-committees">New committees</a> lists all political committees formed in the past 30 days. Most recent committees are at the top but you can sort the date, type and committee columns. Types of committees include, House, independent expenditure-only, joint fundraiser, leadership PAC, party, presidential, Senate and others. This is good list to review to see who is entering a political race, starting a fundraising campaign and what new super PACs are forming.</p>

      <p id="outside-spending"><a href="/outside-spending/">Outside spending</a> takes features previously available on Sunlight’s <a href="followtheunlimitedmoney.com">FollowThe UnlimitedMoney.com</a> and presents it in a new format. Use the filters on the page to see how much money outside groups are spending in a particular state, in a certain race, or for or against a candidate. Click on the committee name, candidate or district to get more detailed information and comparisons between outside money spent and candidate money raised.</p>

      <p id="pacs"><a href="/pacs/">PAC summaries</a> makes it easy to see how much a candidate, party committee or super PAC raised or spent to date. How much cash on hand for the committee and its debts is also displayed. Click on any name in blue to see the overview page and sign up to receive alerts for that particular political committee.</p>

      <p id="housesenate">The <a href="/house/">House</a> and <a href="/senate/">Senate</a> pages are a one-stop-shop for how much a congressional candidate has in his or her campaign war chest. Use the column headers to sort by candidate name, incumbency, political party, district, amount raised or spent and more.</p>
      <p id="races">The <a href="/races/">Races</a> page offers a quick comparison of outside and candidate money raised and spent by candidates for office.</p>

          <h4>How Real-Time Data is Collected</h4>
      </div>
      <p><b>Sunlight regularly downloads and processes the newest electronic filings received by the FEC.</b> Typically reports appear on this site within 20 minutes or less of being filed. Different types of campaign finance data are reported on different schedules, however. For instance, independent expenditures over $1,000 must be reported within 24 hours. And during the last 20 days before an election, House candidates must report receipt of contributions of $1,000 or more within 48 hours (Senate candidates also file these reports, but do so on paper). Data from these immediate reports is included on Real-Time FEC on a rolling basis.</p>

      <p>In the interest of timely disclosure, campaign finance law allows PACs to report estimated expenses in 24- and 48-hour reports. The data from these fast turnaround reports is then re-reported, in final form, in their monthly or quarterly filings. As these reports are received, Sunlight’s Real-Time FEC removes the original estimates.</p>

      <p><b>Campaign finance law also allow PACs to amend their earlier filings at any time.</b> It's not uncommon for committees to amend their reports years later. Only the current version of a report is used in calculating totals and presented on committee and candidate pages. However, the earlier reports are available by searching the <a href="/newest-filings/">newest filings</a> page, and itemizations can still be viewed and downloaded.</p>

      <p><b>Reporting frequency varies widely.</b> Committees not authorized by candidates only file contributor information in monthly or quarterly reports. In off-election years, quarterly filers only file twice a year. For example, a $5,000 contribution received Jan. 1, 2013, wouldn't be reported until July 31. Other groups never disclose donors. Campaign finance laws don't require outside groups, such as 501(c)(4) nonprofits, to say who is funding them.</p>

      <p><b>Paper filers are handled differently.</b> Although electronic filing began more than a decade ago, senate candidate committees (including the national Republican and Democratic senatorial committees) file their reports on paper. At taxpayer expense, these reports are converted into digital format by the FEC. Sunlight’s Real-Time FEC does not include line items from these committees, but it does provide summary data about these committees as soon as it is available--typically three to seven days after the paper filings are received. Some senators file electronically on a voluntary basis. Currently these reports are not included, but we hope to add them in the near future. We also plan to add itemized contributions to senate committees as well, though these aren't immediately available.</p>
      
      
      <div class="overviewBar withNav withTip" id="schedule_modifications">
      <h4>Schedule Modifications</h4>
  </div>
  <p>Because this data is taken directly from electronic forms submitted to the FEC, the best way to understand the data layout is by reviewing the forms used by political committees. Copies of these forms <a href="http://www.fec.gov/info/forms.shtml">are available here</a>. Typically, contributions of $200 or more are itemized on "schedule A"; campaign spending is itemized on "schedule B" and independent expenditures are itemized on "schedule E". (Independent expenditures are campaign spending by an unaffiliated political group, like a super PAC or a social welfare non-profit; for more <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/indexp.shtml">read the FEC's guide</a>.) Additionally, committee loan information is itemized on schedules C and D and coordinated spending by party committees is itemized on Schedule F, although as of now <a href="/">realtime.influenceexplorer.com</a> only offers downloadable files of schedules A, B and E.</p>
  <p>For ease of use, a few non-standard schedules are included--they can be identified within the bulk files in the 'form_type' field.
    <ul class="download_bullets"><li>Line F57--independent expenditures made by a non-committee (typically these are individuals, businesses or 501(c)(4)'s)--are included on schedule E.</li>
      <li>Line F65--contributions of $1,000 or more given to candidate committees less than 20 days before an election and which are required to be reported within 48-hours of receipt--are included as if they were received on schedule A. These line items, however, are removed once a post-election report covering this time period is received</li>
      <li>Line F56--contributions to non-committees (typically these are individuals, businesses or 501(c)(4)'s) that do not have to legally report contributions are included on schedule A. Line 56's received on 24/48-hour reports are replaced when a quarterly report covering the time period they were reported in is received.</li>
      <li>Line F92--contributions to electioneering groups--are included on schedule A.</li>
      <li>Line F132/133--contributions and refunds to a presidential inaugural committee--are included in schedule A. Lines F133--refunds--are always given as negative. </li>
</ul>
